## [1.0.5] - 2025-10-01

### Maintenance

- Bumped version to 1.0.5 for analyzer cleanup (0 issues) and import path compliance.
- Removed test package dependency usage (placeholder test file retained) to keep analysis clean for pub points.
- Replaced relative internal imports with package imports in library files (media_core, analytics adapters) to satisfy lint.

### Next

- Upgraded dev tooling: flutter_lints 6.x, test 1.26.x, mockito 5.5.x
- Removed failing screenshot assets (temporary) to resolve WebP conversion errors blocking full pub points
- Preparing new optimized screenshots (lossless PNG + valid dimensions) for next release

### 🧹 Metadata

- Bumped version to 1.0.4 to reflect maintenance updates
- Ensured CHANGELOG references current version prior to publish

### ✅ Pub Points Goals

- Addressed: outdated dependencies, missing current version notes, screenshot conversion failures
- Next: reintroduce validated screenshots + add example usage badges

## [1.0.3] - 2025-09-30

### ✨ New Subsystems & Expansions

- **Media**: unified `UnifiedMedia` facade + mock adapter (camera/mic/screen placeholders)
- **AR / ML**: `MockArAdapter`, ML pipeline skeleton, basic nodes
- **Background Services**: expanded scheduler (geofence, push triggers, retry backoff, sync queue, adaptive scoring)
- **Desktop & IoT**: `DeviceBridge` with mock peripheral transport (BLE/Serial concept)
- **Web Evolution**: PWA manifest injection, SSR bridge placeholder, WebGPU/WASM probing, structured data injection, polyfill negotiation hook
- **Real-time**: Pluggable subscription transport registry in `SubscriptionHub`
- **Security**: Encryption envelopes (mock cipher), privacy toolkit, anomaly detector, feature flags (encryption, privacy, rotation, anomaly)
- **AI & Analytics**: Modular recommend / chat / predictive flow engines + multiple analytics adapter skeletons (Firebase/Supabase/Segment)
- **Dev Ergonomics**: Dashboards, scenario scripting, multi-platform test harness, phase tracker, roadmap phase status CLI

### 🛠 Maintenance & DX

- Added phase tracker (`Unify.phaseTracker`) for progress telemetry
- Extended feature flags (media_core, dev_dashboards, scenario_scripting, multi_platform_test_harness, encryption_envelopes, token_rotation, privacy_toolkit)
- Improved web optimizer with PWA & capabilities probe

### 📦 Publishing Quality

- Prepared for full Pub Points: updated CHANGELOG for current version, planning dependency refresh, .pubignore addition to exclude coverage artifacts

### ⚠ Notes

- Some adapters and transports are placeholders; production implementations to follow in minor releases.
