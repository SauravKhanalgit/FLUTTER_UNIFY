# Flutter Unify Roadmap

A forward-looking vision of planned and aspirational capabilities.

## 1. Truly Hybrid + Native Bridging
- Unified bridging layer (Flutter ↔ iOS/Android/Desktop/Web)
- Auto-generated bindings for native modules
- Dynamic surface embedding: `Unify.page.pushNativeOrFlutter(...)`
- Shared reactive state stores (MobX/Redux style) across boundaries
- Legacy host app coexistence + gradual modular migration

## 2. AI‑Augmented Developer Experience
- AI-driven CLI: `unify generate auth --ai`
- Context-aware adapter recommendations (network, storage, auth)
- AI-enriched autocompletion & inline hints
- Automatic error pattern + retry boilerplate generation

## 3. Advanced Networking & Backend Integration
- Unified REST + GraphQL + real-time subscriptions
- Automatic offline-first caching & sync queues
- Intelligent edge routing + latency-aware selection
- Pluggable transport (HTTP/2, WebSocket, gRPC, SSE)

## 4. Cross-Platform Media + AR/VR
- Unified camera, mic, gallery, screen capture APIs
- AR/VR hooks (ARCore/ARKit/WebXR) via adapter layer
- Real-time ML pipelines (face, object, OCR, gestures)
- Media stream transformation + composable filters

## 5. Universal Background Services
- Cross-platform job scheduler (periodic, deferred, geofence, push triggers)
- Adaptive power/battery optimization (AI heuristics)
- Unified notification actions + deep link routing
- Background data sync + resilient retry orchestration

## 6. Desktop & IoT Integration
- Advanced multi-window + multi-monitor control
- Device bridge: `Unify.device.connect('esp32')`
- Unified IPC + peripheral channels (BLE, USB, serial)
- System services: clipboard, FS, global input, audio routing

## 7. Web Evolution
- First-class PWA (install, offline manifest, caching strategies)
- Built-in SEO + structured data + optional SSR bridge
- WebGPU + WASM acceleration path for compute/render
- Smart polyfill + ES module negotiation

## 8. Security & Privacy First
- Biometric + token lifecycle + rotating keys
- End-to-end encryption envelopes (data + transport)
- Privacy compliance helpers (GDPR/CCPA tagging + purge APIs)
- Anomaly detection (auth + traffic patterns)

## 9. Modular AI + Analytics Ecosystem
- Pluggable analytics adapters (Firebase, Supabase, Segment, Custom)
- AI modules: recommendations, chat orchestration, predictive flows
- Dynamic feature flags + experimentation service
- Behavior-driven adaptive UX hooks

## 10. Extreme Developer Ergonomics
- Unified surface: `Unify.auth / network / media / events / state / desktop / ai`
- Live visual dashboards: streams, events, network timelines
- Hot reload across native + Flutter hybrid shells
- One test spec → multi-platform execution + diff harness
- Scenario scripting + synthetic telemetry injection

## Phased Delivery (Indicative)
- Phase 1: AI CLI, offline networking, roadmap publication
- Phase 2: Native bridging layer + background scheduler
- Phase 3: AR/VR + ML pipelines + analytics adapters
- Phase 4: WebGPU/WASM + edge routing + experimentation framework
- Phase 5: Security automation + hybrid legacy embedding maturity

## Contribution Guidance
- Mark proposals under `/design/*.md`
- Use labels: `proposal`, `adapter`, `ai`, `infra`
- Draft RFC → lightweight POC → adapter integration → stabilization

## Tracking
Public issues + milestones in GitHub will reflect active items.

Roadmap is directional and may evolve based on community input.
